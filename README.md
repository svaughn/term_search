# term_search
Powershell Script that compares google seach frequence of terms in a list 

I wanted to know what the most frequently cited MQ commands, IIB commands and IIB nodes are.
This script:
* reads a list of terms in from a file
* does a goole search on each term
* records the result count for each turn
* sorts the items by count
* creates csv file with the results
